# AI-DS - repository for learning resources for Artificial Intelligence & Decision Systems Section
In this repository there are learning resources for members of Artificial Intelligence & Decision Systems Section of SKN Data & AI Student Research Group. Each directory is named in the same way: the numbers indicates the meeting number. In each directory there is presentation that covers topic of each meeting and another directory, where are notebooks. Notebooks contain practical use of aspects included in presentation. Some of them include exercises that help consolidate knowledge.
## Topics of meetings:
* s1 - Introduction to Python libraries useful for machine learning and data analysis - Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
* s2 - Classification - main concepts, types of classification, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning.
* s3 - Algorithms of classification - when and how use them.
* s4 - Ensemble learning - voting, bagging, boosting, stacking.
* s5 - Regression - types of regression, regression algorithms, ensemble regression, model evaluation.
